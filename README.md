# Gemini-Pro-App
- Create a virtual environment and install all the depdencies.
- Generate the key for Gemini-Pro using 'https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey', and save it in .env file.
- Here, I have integrated both the normal 'Gemini-Pro' Application for Question & Answer requests and the 'Gemini-Pro-Vision' for image related search.
- app.py contains the Q&A app code, and vision.py contains the image model code.
