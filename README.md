# Gemini-Pro-App
- Create a virtual environment and install all the depdencies.
- Generate the key for Gemini-Pro using 'https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey'.
- Here, I have integrated both the normal 'Gemini-Pro' Application for Question & Answer requests and the 'Gemini-Pro-Vision' for Image related search.
- app.py has the Q&A app code and vison.py has the Image model code.
